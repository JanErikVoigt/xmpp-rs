Version NEXT:
  * Additions:
    - Add missing check for JIDs with too many `@` before the resource, such as
      `a@b@c` or `a@b@c/d` which should clearly be invalid.  The new error it
      produces is named `TooManyAts`.
    - domainparts are now checked much more in-depth, using the idna crate and
      various custom rules.

Version 0.11.1, release 2024-07-23:
  * Breaking:
    - Move InnerJid into Jid and reformulate BareJid and FullJid in terms of
      Jid.
    - With the addition of `str`-like types for `DomainPart`, `NodePart` and
      `ResourcePart`, the functions on `Jid`, `BareJid` and `FullJid` which
      return the respective types have been changed to return references
      instead. Use `ToOwned::to_owned` to obtain a copy or `.as_str()` to
      obtain a plain `str` reference.
    - The `node_str`, `domain_str` and `resource_str` functions returning str
      references have been removed from the JID types. Use `.as_str()` or
      `.map(|x| x.as_str())` on the corresponding `node`/`domain`/`resource`
      functions instead.
  * Additions:
    - Add optional quote support. Implement quote::ToTokens for Jid, FullJid
      and BareJid.
    - `str`-like reference types have been added for `DomainPart`, `NodePart`
      and `ResourcePart`, called `DomainRef`, `NodeRef` and `ResourceRef`
      respectively.
    - Convenience methods to combine `DomainPart` and `NodePart` to a
      `BareJid` have been added, including
      `impl From<DomainPart> for BareJid` and
      `impl From<DomainPart> for Jid`, both of which are (unlike
      `::from_parts`) copy-free.
    - `as_str` methods have been added on all Jid types.
    - Derive PartialOrd/Ord for Jid types.
    - Implement `Borrow<Jid>` on `FullJid` and `BareJid`.
    - Make the crate no_std
    - Update to edition 2021.
    - Use debug_tuple instead of string formatting to get standard-like
      output.
    - Improve perfs of comparison operators (#123)
    - Add more test cases
    - Fix clippy lints, cargo doc, and other warnings
    - xso::FromXmlText and xso::AsXmlText are now implemented for NodePart,
      DomainPart, and ResourcePart (!485)
    - serde::Serialize and serde::Deserialize are now derived for NodePart,
      DomainPart, and ResourcePart when serde feature flag is enabled (!499)


Version 0.11.0, release 2024-07-23 [YANKED]

Version 0.10.0, release 2023-08-17:
  * Breaking
    - serde: Jid is now using untagged enum representation (#66)
    - JidParseError has been renamed Error
    - Jid::new, FullJid::new, and BareJid::new now take a single stringy argument and return a Result ;
    to build JIDs from separate parts, use the from_parts() method instead (#204)
  * Additions
    - Parsing invalid JIDs with stringprep feature no longer results in panic,
    returning Error with NodePrep, NamePrep or ResourcePrep variant instead (#84)
    - Parsing already-normalized JIDs with stringprep is much faster, about 20 times.
    - JID parts are now typed as NodePart, DomainPart and ResourcePart ; once part into those types,
    JID operations cannot fail
    - BareJid::with_resource appends a ResourcePart to a BareJid to produce a FullJid (#204)
    - BareJid::with_resource_str appends a stringy resource to a BareJid to produce a FullJid, and can fail
    in case of resource stringprep or length check error (#204)
    - Jid::from_parts, BareJid::from_parts, and FullJid::from_parts enable to build JIDs from typed Parts
    and cannot fail (#204)
    - Jid::node(), BareJid::node(), and FullJid::node() now return an option of the typed NodePart ; the
    node_str() method returns the same information as a string slice (#204)
    - Jid::domain(), BareJid::domain(), and FullJid::domain() now return the typed DomainPart ; the
    domain_str() method returns the same information as a string slice (#204)
    - FullJid::resource() returns the typed ResourcePart ; the resource_str() method returns the same
    information as a string slice (#204)
    - Jid::resource() returns an optional typed ResourcePart ; the resource_str() method returns the same
    information as a string slice (#204)
    - Add serde_test in tests to ensure correctness of Serialize / Deserialize implementations.
